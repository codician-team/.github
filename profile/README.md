# Codician

**Codician** is a software engineering collective focused on building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.  
We operate with engineering rigor, clean collaboration workflows, and long-term technical vision.

This organization hosts projects developed, reviewed, and maintained by professional engineers who value clarity, performance, and operational reliability.

## Engineering Principles

- **Correctness first** — predictable behavior over premature abstraction.  
- **Maintainability** — readable, documented, and testable code.  
- **Scalability** — systems designed for growth, not just MVPs.  
- **Security awareness** — defensive engineering as a default.  
- **Pragmatism** — business value without compromising technical integrity.

## Organization Standards

Across all repositories we follow:

- Structured branching strategies  
- Mandatory code reviews  
- CI-validated builds  
- Test coverage for critical logic  
- Clear documentation and commit history  
- Issue-driven development

Each repository documents its own architectural decisions and contribution rules.

---

## Open Source Philosophy

We believe in contributing back to the ecosystem by:

- Publishing reusable tools and libraries  
- Sharing engineering patterns and utilities  
- Maintaining clean and accessible documentation  

Open source is treated as production-grade, not experimental.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and evaluated with the same standards as internal work.

Before submitting:

1. Review repository documentation.  
2. Follow commit and branch conventions.  
3. Include tests for functional changes.  
4. Keep pull requests focused and well-described.

Quality and clarity matter more than velocity.

## Governance & Communication

Technical decisions are documented in repository READMEs, ADRs, or RFCs when applicable.  
Questions, proposals, and discussions should be opened as GitHub issues in the relevant repository.
